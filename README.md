# DS-kNN-K-Fold-CV
An implementation of the **k-Nearest Neighbours Classification Algorithm** using some popular demo datasets. 


We have also demonstrated the use of K-Fold Cross validation using the training data to determine the best value of the hyperparameter k on [this](HyperparameterTuning_KFoldCV.ipynb) file. The decision surface has been shown using two different approaches : 
* Implementing from scratch using Meshgrid [here](KNN_Decision_Surface_From_Scratch.ipynb)
* Using mlxtend library [here](KNN_Automated_Decision_Surface.ipynb).
